# material library

Flutter widgets implementing Material Design.

To use, import `package:flutter/material.dart`.

See also:

- [flutter.dev/widgets](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/https://flutter.dev/widgets/) for a catalog of commonly-used Flutter widgets.

# MaterialApp class

An application that uses material design.

A convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly required for material design applications. It builds upon a [WidgetsApp](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsApp-class.html) by adding material-design specific functionality, such as [AnimatedTheme](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AnimatedTheme-class.html) and [GridPaper](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridPaper-class.html).

The [MaterialApp](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html) configures the top-level [Navigator](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html) to search for routes in the following order:

1. For the `/` route, the [home](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/home.html) property, if non-null, is used.
    
2. Otherwise, the [routes](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/routes.html) table is used, if it has an entry for the route.
    
3. Otherwise, [onGenerateRoute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/onGenerateRoute.html) is called, if provided. It should return a non-null value for any _valid_ route not handled by [home](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/home.html) and [routes](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/routes.html).
    
4. Finally if all else fails [onUnknownRoute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/onUnknownRoute.html) is called.
    

If a [Navigator](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html) is created, at least one of these options must handle the `/` route, since it is used when an invalid [initialRoute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/initialRoute.html) is specified on startup (e.g. by another application launching this one with an intent on Android; see [Window.defaultRouteName](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Window/defaultRouteName.html)).

This widget also configures the observer of the top-level [Navigator](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html) (if any) to perform [Hero](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Hero-class.html) animations.

If [home](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/home.html), [routes](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/routes.html), [onGenerateRoute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/onGenerateRoute.html), and [onUnknownRoute](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/onUnknownRoute.html) are all null, and [builder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/builder.html) is not null, then no [Navigator](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html) is created.
