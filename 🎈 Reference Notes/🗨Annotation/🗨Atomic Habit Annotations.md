change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the
wrong way**

understand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which
change can occur.

outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.**

Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the
first person says, ‚ÄúNo thanks. I‚Äôm trying to quit.‚Äù It sounds like a
reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker
who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will
change while carrying around the same beliefs.
The second person declines by saying, ‚ÄúNo thanks. I‚Äôm not a
smoker.‚Äù It‚Äôs a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in
identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one.
They no longer identify as someone who smokes.

The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado,
provides a good example. ‚ÄúFor as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve chewed
my fingernails,‚Äù Clark told me. ‚ÄúIt started as a nervous habit when I
was young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual.
One day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit.
Through mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it.‚Äù

Then, Clark did something surprising.
‚ÄúI asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy
thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn‚Äôt
chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What
happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the
first time. The manicurist even said that‚Äîother than the chewing‚ÄîI
had really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my
fingernails. And even though that‚Äôs something I had never aspired to, it
made all the difference. I‚Äôve never chewed my nails since; not even a
single close call. And it‚Äôs because I now take pride in properly caring
for them.‚Äù

Our
prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the
location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend
most of our time learning cues that p#redict secondary rewards like
money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and
friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these
pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction,
which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)

The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop.
They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This
‚Äúhabit loop‚Äù is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will
happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results

We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope
it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is
not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous
work we have done. This can result in a ‚Äúvalley of disappointment‚Äù where
people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work
without experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was
simply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous
efforts is revealed
