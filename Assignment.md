# Introduction

-   How bad Covid-19 is for our economy?

    > Globally, as of 9:53am CET, 18 December 2020, there have been 73,275,943 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,650,348 deaths, reported to WHO.
    > American has mostly confirmed Covid-19 cases and the situation is rising.

    > The Covid-19 pandemic is a global shock ‘like no other’, involving simultaneous disruptions to both supply and demand in an interconnected world economy.

# Effect on the GDP

> This study simulates the potential impact of COVID-19 on gross domestic product and trade, using a standard global computable general equilibrium model. It models the shock as underutilization of labor and capital, an increase in international trade costs, a drop in travel services, and a redirection of demand away from activities that require proximity between people. ==A baseline global pandemic scenario sees gross domestic product fall by 2 percent below the benchmark for the world, 2.5 percent for developing countries, and 1.8 percent for industrial countries. The declines are nearly 4 percent below the benchmark for the world, in an amplified pandemic scenario in which containment is assumed to take longer and which now seems more likely.== The biggest negative shock is recorded in the output of domestic services affected by the pandemic, as well as in traded tourist services. Since the model does not capture fully the social isolation induced independent contraction in demand and the decline in investor confidence, the eventual economic impact may be different. This exercise is illustrative, because it is still too early to make an informed assessment of the full impact of the pandemic. But it does convey the likely extent of impending global economic pain, especially for developing countries and their potential need for assistance.

>_What we have learned from the first COVID-19 wave? Insights into how different European countries reacted to the pandemic and how the diverse coping strategies affected their respective economies in the first half of this year. Interesting lessons to be learnt as we enter into a prolonged period of the pandemic._
>The world has come to understand that the COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc on the global economy and will continue to do so for some time. The table below shows the annual growth rate of Switzerland’s GDP, which shrank by a record 8.3% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2020.
>**_Swiss GDP: Annual Growth Rate_**![GDP1](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog-EHL-Insights/Images-EHL-Insights/GDP1.png?width=768&name=GDP1.png)
>This article aims to share **five interesting findings** that were discovered after several indicators of **34 European countries** were analyzed. The data were considered between January and August 2020\. The indicators were the following by country:
*   Degree of stringency of the lockdown measures
*   GDP annual growth rate
*   Unemployment rate
*   General level of trust in government
*   Degree of individualism vs collectivism beliefs of the population
*   Degree of severity of the health situation caused by the virus
*   Healthcare system capacity

>The graph below compares the severity of the lockdown measures according to several European countries. We see that Sweden was constantly less restrictive on the lockdown measures. In parallel, we observe that Italy was one of the first European countries affected by the virus which explains the severity of the lockdown measures. As far as Switzerland is concerned, one can claim that, in general, the lockdown was less severe compared to the other European countries. Indeed, the Swiss strategy consisted in relying on the population to follow the government’s health recommendations and for citizens to exhibit personal responsibility.

>Under the assumption that the pandemic and required containment peaks in the second quarter for most countries in the world, and recedes in the second half of this year, in the April [_World Economic Outlook_](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020) we project global growth in 2020 to fall to -3 percent. This is a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points from January 2020, a major revision over a very short period. This makes the Great Lockdown the worst recession since the Great Depression, and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis.[![](https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eng-apr-12-weo1.png)](https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eng-apr-12-weo1.png)

# Effect on unemployment
> ![https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/371/bmj.m3687/F1.medium.jpg](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/371/bmj.m3687/F1.medium.jpg)
> Although unemployment soared in response to covid-19 in some nations, the policy measures undertaken by others have prevented many workers from becoming technically unemployed. In the United Kingdom, the headline rate of unemployment for April-June 2020 was 3.9%—only slightly higher than the 3.89% rate in April-June 2019. Yet in June 2020 9.3 million people were in the coronavirus job retention scheme (“furlough”) and another 2.7 million had claimed a self-employment income support scheme grant; there had been the largest ever decrease in weekly hours worked; 650 000 fewer workers were reported on payrolls in June than in March; and the benefit claimant count had more than doubled from 1.24 million to 2.63 million people.[3](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3687#ref-3) The Australian Bureau of Statistics has produced an adjusted estimate of Australian unemployment that includes all those temporarily stood down or laid off, to allow a closer comparison with US and Canadian statistics ([fig 1](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3687#F1)). As emergency support measures are wound back, concern is growing that the downwards trend from the April peak might not be maintained in coming months.

# Effect on Inflation

> Sharp changes in consumer expenditure may bias inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
> The consumer price index (CPI) does not reflect these abrupt changes in spending patterns because the CPI weights are not continuously updated. For example, the CPI could be pulled down by a decline in the prices of nonessentials that are no longer purchased.

> A new IMF [staff paper](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/11/05/COVID-19-and-the-CPI-Is-Inflation-Underestimated-49856) uses spending estimates derived from credit and debit card data to adjust the CPI weights to match spending patterns during the pandemic. The study finds that inflation during the first three months of the pandemic was actually higher than we thought.
> The chart of the week looks at the difference over the February–May timeframe between a COVID-19 price index that adjusts the CPI weights based on the impacts of COVID-19 on spending in Canada and an index with unchanged CPI weights. The diamonds in the chart show the difference between the two indexes by region. In seven of the eight regions shown, the CPI is below the COVID-19 index. Looking at the average for all regions combined, the gap is 0.23 percentage points.![](https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/eng-cotw-cpi-nov-3-chart-1-872x1024.png)

> The main positive contributors to the gap between the COVID-19 index and the CPI are food and transport, each contributing 0.16 percentage points to the world gap. Rising food prices contribute to the faster growth of the COVID-19 index in all eight regions. Falling transport prices, which have a larger weight in the CPI than in the COVID-19 index, also contribute to the faster growth of the COVID-19 index in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa.

> The main negative contributors to the world gap are housing, which contributes –0.03 percentage points, and clothing, which contributes –0.08 percentage points. Housing has a higher weight in the COVID-19 index than in the CPI, but its price index is so close to the overall CPI that increasing its weight does little to move the COVID-19 index away from the CPI. The downward effect of clothing is due to seasonal price increases having a smaller weight in the COVID-19 basket.

> Despite the finding that CPI weights underestimated inflation in the early months of the pandemic, a quick update of the CPI weights to reflect the spending patterns during the pandemic would be impractical. Furthermore, introducing weights that are based on a short timeframe can reduce an index’s accuracy over the longer run. A better approach would be for statistical agencies to develop a supplementary index whose weights reflect spending patterns during the pandemic. This would give policymakers a better picture of the effect of inflation on the prices that consumers are actually paying.

>On July 24, 2020, I came across a news article published in the Bangla daily _Prothom Alo_, which mentioned that recently there has been an increase in the premature withdrawal of National Savings Schemes (NSS). It can easily be surmised that many savers, faced with declines in their incomes due to the pandemic, have felt pressured to withdraw their savings with the NSS forgoing the promised higher interest rate. According to the news article, between July 2019 and May 2020 the Directorate of National Savings Bangladesh (DNSB) had issued national savings certificates (NSC) worth Tk 57,805 crore. During the same period, NSC holders sold off NSCs worth Tk 46,794 crore. This basically means that the net value of NSCs sold in the eleven-month period was Tk 11,011 crore. According to the same news article, the trend in NSC transactions in the past three months has been even more worrisome. For instance, in April 2020, the net value of NSCs sold was Tk (-) 354 crore. In other words, more NSCs were withdrawn than were issued by the DNSB in April. This speaks volumes about the adverse impact of the current pandemic on the economy of Bangladesh and indicates a further decline in the net value of NSCs sold at least in the short run.

>According to UNCTAD's latest nowcasts (run on 8.12.2020), the value of global merchandise trade is predicted to fall by 5.6% in 2020 compared with last year. This would be the biggest fall in merchandise trade since 2009, when trade fell by 22%. This is a significantly more optimistic nowcast than only a few weeks ago when UNCTAD nowcasts were estimating a fall of 9%.

>The nowcasts – data-led projections for the immediate future – were published today as part of UNCTAD’s comprehensive annual [Handbook of Statistics for 2020](https://unctad.org/webflyer/handbook-statistics-2020), which presents the statistical landscape for 2019 with nowcasts for 2020.

>The predicted decline in services trade is much greater, with services likely to fall by 15.4% in 2020 compared with 2019. This would be the biggest decline in services trade since 1990, when this series began. In 2009, following the global financial crisis, services trade fell by 9.5%
