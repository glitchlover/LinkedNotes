# Introduction

-   How bad Covid-19 is for our economy?

    > Globally, as of 9:53am CET, 18 December 2020, there have been 73,275,943 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,650,348 deaths, reported to WHO.
    > American has mostly confirmed Covid-19 cases and the situation is rising.

    > The Covid-19 pandemic is a global shock ‘like no other’, involving simultaneous disruptions to both supply and demand in an interconnected world economy.

# Effect on the GDP

> This study simulates the potential impact of COVID-19 on gross domestic product and trade, using a standard global computable general equilibrium model. It models the shock as underutilization of labor and capital, an increase in international trade costs, a drop in travel services, and a redirection of demand away from activities that require proximity between people. A baseline global pandemic scenario sees gross domestic product fall by 2 percent below the benchmark for the world, 2.5 percent for developing countries, and 1.8 percent for industrial countries. The declines are nearly 4 percent below the benchmark for the world, in an amplified pandemic scenario in which containment is assumed to take longer and which now seems more likely. The biggest negative shock is recorded in the output of domestic services affected by the pandemic, as well as in traded tourist services. Since the model does not capture fully the social isolation induced independent contraction in demand and the decline in investor confidence, the eventual economic impact may be different. This exercise is illustrative, because it is still too early to make an informed assessment of the full impact of the pandemic. But it does convey the likely extent of impending global economic pain, especially for developing countries and their potential need for assistance.

# Effect on unemployment

> More than 470 million people worldwide are currently unemployed or underemployed, the United Nations has revealed in a [new report compiled by the International Labor Organization (ILO)](https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_734454/lang--en/index.htm).
> The global unemployment rate remained relatively stable during the 2010s, according to the report. But the [global unemployment rate](https://www.dw.com/en/employment-fails-to-protect-against-poverty-study-shows/a-51546581) is expected to rise by 2.5 million in 2020, from 188 million to 190.5 million people.
> "For millions of working people, it is becoming increasingly difficult, I think, to build better lives through work," ILO chief Guy Ryder told reporters in Geneva.
> The annual World Employment and Social Outlook report stressed [not only the unemployed but also the underemployed](https://www.dw.com/en/true-scale-of-german-underemployment-revealed/a-50886887). Some 285 million people worldwide are considered underemployed, meaning they either work less than they want to, have given up searching for work or otherwise lack access to the labor market.
> The figure of 470 million represents around 13% of the global labor force, the report said.

# Effect on Inflation

> Sharp changes in consumer expenditure may bias inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
> The consumer price index (CPI) does not reflect these abrupt changes in spending patterns because the CPI weights are not continuously updated. For example, the CPI could be pulled down by a decline in the prices of nonessentials that are no longer purchased.

> A new IMF [staff paper](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/11/05/COVID-19-and-the-CPI-Is-Inflation-Underestimated-49856) uses spending estimates derived from credit and debit card data to adjust the CPI weights to match spending patterns during the pandemic. The study finds that inflation during the first three months of the pandemic was actually higher than we thought.
> The chart of the week looks at the difference over the February–May timeframe between a COVID-19 price index that adjusts the CPI weights based on the impacts of COVID-19 on spending in Canada and an index with unchanged CPI weights. The diamonds in the chart show the difference between the two indexes by region. In seven of the eight regions shown, the CPI is below the COVID-19 index. Looking at the average for all regions combined, the gap is 0.23 percentage points.![](https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/eng-cotw-cpi-nov-3-chart-1-872x1024.png)

> The main positive contributors to the gap between the COVID-19 index and the CPI are food and transport, each contributing 0.16 percentage points to the world gap. Rising food prices contribute to the faster growth of the COVID-19 index in all eight regions. Falling transport prices, which have a larger weight in the CPI than in the COVID-19 index, also contribute to the faster growth of the COVID-19 index in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa.

> The main negative contributors to the world gap are housing, which contributes –0.03 percentage points, and clothing, which contributes –0.08 percentage points. Housing has a higher weight in the COVID-19 index than in the CPI, but its price index is so close to the overall CPI that increasing its weight does little to move the COVID-19 index away from the CPI. The downward effect of clothing is due to seasonal price increases having a smaller weight in the COVID-19 basket.

> Despite the finding that CPI weights underestimated inflation in the early months of the pandemic, a quick update of the CPI weights to reflect the spending patterns during the pandemic would be impractical. Furthermore, introducing weights that are based on a short timeframe can reduce an index’s accuracy over the longer run. A better approach would be for statistical agencies to develop a supplementary index whose weights reflect spending patterns during the pandemic. This would give policymakers a better picture of the effect of inflation on the prices that consumers are actually paying.
