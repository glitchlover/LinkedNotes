# Introduction

-   How bad Covid-19 is for our economy?

    > Globally, as of 9:53am CET, 18 December 2020, there have been 73,275,943 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,650,348 deaths, reported to WHO.
    > American has mostly confirmed Covid-19 cases and the situation is rising.

    > The Covid-19 pandemic is a global shock ‘like no other’, involving simultaneous disruptions to both supply and demand in an interconnected world economy.

# Effect on the GDP

> This study simulates the potential impact of COVID-19 on gross domestic product and trade, using a standard global computable general equilibrium model. It models the shock as underutilization of labor and capital, an increase in international trade costs, a drop in travel services, and a redirection of demand away from activities that require proximity between people. A baseline global pandemic scenario sees gross domestic product fall by 2 percent below the benchmark for the world, 2.5 percent for developing countries, and 1.8 percent for industrial countries. The declines are nearly 4 percent below the benchmark for the world, in an amplified pandemic scenario in which containment is assumed to take longer and which now seems more likely. The biggest negative shock is recorded in the output of domestic services affected by the pandemic, as well as in traded tourist services. Since the model does not capture fully the social isolation induced independent contraction in demand and the decline in investor confidence, the eventual economic impact may be different. This exercise is illustrative, because it is still too early to make an informed assessment of the full impact of the pandemic. But it does convey the likely extent of impending global economic pain, especially for developing countries and their potential need for assistance.

# Effect on unemployment

> More than 470 million people worldwide are currently unemployed or underemployed, the United Nations has revealed in a [new report compiled by the International Labor Organization (ILO)](https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_734454/lang--en/index.htm).
> The global unemployment rate remained relatively stable during the 2010s, according to the report. But the [global unemployment rate](https://www.dw.com/en/employment-fails-to-protect-against-poverty-study-shows/a-51546581) is expected to rise by 2.5 million in 2020, from 188 million to 190.5 million people.
> "For millions of working people, it is becoming increasingly difficult, I think, to build better lives through work," ILO chief Guy Ryder told reporters in Geneva.
> The annual World Employment and Social Outlook report stressed [not only the unemployed but also the underemployed](https://www.dw.com/en/true-scale-of-german-underemployment-revealed/a-50886887). Some 285 million people worldwide are considered underemployed, meaning they either work less than they want to, have given up searching for work or otherwise lack access to the labor market.
> The figure of 470 million represents around 13% of the global labor force, the report said.

# Effect on Inflation

> Sharp changes in consumer expenditure may bias inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
> The consumer price index (CPI) does not reflect these abrupt changes in spending patterns because the CPI weights are not continuously updated. For example, the CPI could be pulled down by a decline in the prices of nonessentials that are no longer purchased.

> A new IMF [staff paper](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/11/05/COVID-19-and-the-CPI-Is-Inflation-Underestimated-49856) uses spending estimates derived from credit and debit card data to adjust the CPI weights to match spending patterns during the pandemic. The study finds that inflation during the first three months of the pandemic was actually higher than we thought.
> The chart of the week looks at the difference over the February–May timeframe between a COVID-19 price index that adjusts the CPI weights based on the impacts of COVID-19 on spending in Canada and an index with unchanged CPI weights. The diamonds in the chart show the difference between the two indexes by region. In seven of the eight regions shown, the CPI is below the COVID-19 index. Looking at the average for all regions combined, the gap is 0.23 percentage points.![](https://blogs.imf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/eng-cotw-cpi-nov-3-chart-1-872x1024.png)

> The main positive contributors to the gap between the COVID-19 index and the CPI are food and transport, each contributing 0.16 percentage points to the world gap. Rising food prices contribute to the faster growth of the COVID-19 index in all eight regions. Falling transport prices, which have a larger weight in the CPI than in the COVID-19 index, also contribute to the faster growth of the COVID-19 index in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa.

> The main negative contributors to the world gap are housing, which contributes –0.03 percentage points, and clothing, which contributes –0.08 percentage points. Housing has a higher weight in the COVID-19 index than in the CPI, but its price index is so close to the overall CPI that increasing its weight does little to move the COVID-19 index away from the CPI. The downward effect of clothing is due to seasonal price increases having a smaller weight in the COVID-19 basket.

> Despite the finding that CPI weights underestimated inflation in the early months of the pandemic, a quick update of the CPI weights to reflect the spending patterns during the pandemic would be impractical. Furthermore, introducing weights that are based on a short timeframe can reduce an index’s accuracy over the longer run. A better approach would be for statistical agencies to develop a supplementary index whose weights reflect spending patterns during the pandemic. This would give policymakers a better picture of the effect of inflation on the prices that consumers are actually paying.

>On July 24, 2020, I came across a news article published in the Bangla daily _Prothom Alo_, which mentioned that recently there has been an increase in the premature withdrawal of National Savings Schemes (NSS). It can easily be surmised that many savers, faced with declines in their incomes due to the pandemic, have felt pressured to withdraw their savings with the NSS forgoing the promised higher interest rate. According to the news article, between July 2019 and May 2020 the Directorate of National Savings Bangladesh (DNSB) had issued national savings certificates (NSC) worth Tk 57,805 crore. During the same period, NSC holders sold off NSCs worth Tk 46,794 crore. This basically means that the net value of NSCs sold in the eleven-month period was Tk 11,011 crore. According to the same news article, the trend in NSC transactions in the past three months has been even more worrisome. For instance, in April 2020, the net value of NSCs sold was Tk (-) 354 crore. In other words, more NSCs were withdrawn than were issued by the DNSB in April. This speaks volumes about the adverse impact of the current pandemic on the economy of Bangladesh and indicates a further decline in the net value of NSCs sold at least in the short run.

>Bangladesh’s point-to-point general inflation rate has increased to 6.44 per cent in October, the highest in seven years, amid the coronavirus (COvid-19) pandemic.

>According to UNCTAD's latest nowcasts (run on 8.12.2020), the value of global merchandise trade is predicted to fall by 5.6% in 2020 compared with last year. This would be the biggest fall in merchandise trade since 2009, when trade fell by 22%. This is a significantly more optimistic nowcast than only a few weeks ago when UNCTAD nowcasts were estimating a fall of 9%.

>The nowcasts – data-led projections for the immediate future – were published today as part of UNCTAD’s comprehensive annual [Handbook of Statistics for 2020](https://unctad.org/webflyer/handbook-statistics-2020), which presents the statistical landscape for 2019 with nowcasts for 2020.

>The predicted decline in services trade is much greater, with services likely to fall by 15.4% in 2020 compared with 2019. This would be the biggest decline in services trade since 1990, when this series began. In 2009, following the global financial crisis, services trade fell by 9.5%
