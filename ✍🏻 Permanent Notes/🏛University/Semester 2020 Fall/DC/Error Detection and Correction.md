# Error Detection and Correction
- There are two types of error :: Single bit error and Burst Error 
	- Single bit error #card 
		- if after transmission only one bit gets corrupted in one data unit then it  is called Single bit error.


	- Burst error #card
		- if after transmission only multiple bits get corrupted in one data unit then it is called  Burst error.

## Block Coding
- In block coding we divide our message :: into two blocks

	- They are::Codewords and Datawords
	
		- Codewords #card
			- We add r redundant bits to each block to make the length n = k+r. The resulting block is codewords 

		- Datawords #card
			- We divide our massage into blocks, each of k bits called datawords.

### Process of Error Detection and Block Coding
