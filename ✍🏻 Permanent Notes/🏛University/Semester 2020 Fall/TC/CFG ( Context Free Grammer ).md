# Context Free Language
 A context language is a language generated by [[ðŸ”‘Context Free Grammar]]
 
 ---
## Definition #card
Context free grammar is a formal grammar which is used to generate all possible strings in a given formal language.

The set "{}" of all CFL is identical to the set  "{}" of languages accepted by [[Pushdown Automata]]

 ### **Context Free Grammar** is defined by . . . #card
- defined by 4 tuples as G = {V, â¨Š / T, P, S} where
	- V = Set of  Variable or [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^bc2370]] Symbol
	- â¨Š / T  = Set of [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^bc2370]] Symbol
	- P = [[Production]] Symbol 
	- S = Start Symbol (a [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^0c9bd3]])

#### Example
*   The grammar ({A}, {a, b, c}, P, A), P : A â†’ aA, A â†’ abc.
*   The grammar ({S, a, b}, {a, b}, P, S), P: S â†’ aSa, S â†’ bSb, S â†’ Îµ
*   The grammar ({S, F}, {0, 1}, P, S), P: S â†’ 00S | 11F, F â†’ 00F | Îµ


### Terminal Symbol #card
- A terminal is a symbol which does not appear on the left-hand side of any production. ^bc2370
- Terminal symbols cannot be changed using the rules of the grammar.
- terminal symbols, which are the characters of the alphabet that appear in the strings generated by the grammar.
- Terminals are the characters that make up the Final Codes

### Non Terminal Symbol #card
- Non terminals are the place holder of [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^bc2370]]  ^0c9bd3
- Non terminal symbols are those symbols which can be replaced.
- Â A non-terminal called the left side of the production, an arrow, and a sequence of tokens and/or on- terminals
-  We can use [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^0c9bd3]] to generate different patterns of terminal symbol

## Start Symbol  
- Def:: the variable represents the language being defined
^1608275875478

## Production
Def :: There are finite set of production/rules that shows the recursive definition of a language

## **Context Free Grammars** (CFG) can be classified on the basis of following two properties:

1) Based on number of strings it generates. #card 
	- If CFG is generating finite number of strings, then CFG is **Non-Recursive** (or Derivation)
	- If CFG can generate infinite number of strings then the grammar is said to be **Recursive** grammar
^1608385871180

2) Based on number of derivation trees. #card
	- If there is only 1 derivation tree then the CFG is unambiguous.
	- If there are more than 1 derivation tree, then the CFG is [ambiguous](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ambiguous-grammar/).

## Derivation of Grammar
Def::A derivation of a string for a grammar is a sequence of grammar rule applications that transform the start symbol into the string.

### Representation Technique
- **Root vertex** âˆ’ Must be labeled by the **start** symbol.
- **Vertex** âˆ’ Labeled by a **non-terminal** symbol.    
- **Leaves** âˆ’ Labeled by a **terminal** symbol or Îµ.
    

If S â†’ x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> â€¦â€¦ x<sub>n</sub> is a production rule in a CFG, then the parse tree / derivation tree will be as follows âˆ’

#### There are two different approaches to draw a derivation tree âˆ’ #card
Top down approach and bottom down approach 
^1608306159104

- **Top-down Approach âˆ’** #card
	- Starts with the starting symbol **S**
	- Goes down to tree leaves using productions
^1608306159485

- **Bottom-up Approach âˆ’** #card
	- Starts from tree leaves
	- Proceeds upward to the root which is the starting symbol **S**
