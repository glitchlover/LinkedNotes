# Context Free Language
 A context language is a language generated by [[ðŸ”‘Context Free Grammar]]
 
 ---
## Definition #card
Context free grammar is a formal grammar which is used to generate all possible strings in a given formal language.

The set "{}" of all CFL is identical to the set  "{}" of languages accepted by [[Pushdown Automata]]

 ### **Context Free Grammar** is defined by . . . #card
- defined by 4 tuples as G = {V, â¨Š / T, P, S} where
	- V = Set of  Variable or [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^bc2370]] Symbol
	- â¨Š / T  = Set of [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^bc2370]] Symbol
	- P = [[Production]] Symbol 
	- S = Start Symbol (a [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^0c9bd3]])

#### Example
*   The grammar ({A}, {a, b, c}, P, A), P : A â†’ aA, A â†’ abc.
*   The grammar ({S, a, b}, {a, b}, P, S), P: S â†’ aSa, S â†’ bSb, S â†’ Îµ
*   The grammar ({S, F}, {0, 1}, P, S), P: S â†’ 00S | 11F, F â†’ 00F | Îµ


### Terminal Symbol #card
- A terminal is a symbol which does not appear on the left-hand side of any production. ^bc2370
- Terminals are the characters that make up the Final Codes
- ^1608044440405

### Non Terminal Symbol #card
- Non terminals are the place holder of [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^bc2370]]  ^0c9bd3
-  We can use [[CFG ( Context Free Grammer )#^0c9bd3]] to generate different patterns of terminal symbol
- ^1608044433908

## Start Symbol  
- Def:: the variable represents the language being defined
^1608275875478

## Production
- Def :: There are finite set of production/rules that shows the recursive definition of a language
