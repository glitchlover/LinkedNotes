# Pushdown Automata
def:: A pushdown automaton is a way to implement a context-free grammar in a similar way we design DFA for a regular grammar. 

A DFA can remember a finite amount of information, but a PDA can remember....:: an infinite amount of information.

- What kind of stack PDA is?:: ε-NFA

-  What kind of NFA PDA is?:: ε-NFA with a stack

## Basic Components
A pushdown automata has three components #card
