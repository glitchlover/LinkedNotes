# Pushdown Automata
def:: A pushdown automaton is a way to implement a context-free grammar in a similar way we design DFA for a regular grammar. 

A DFA can remember a finite amount of information, but a PDA can remember....:: an infinite amount of information.

## Basic Components
A pushdown automata has three components #card 
- An input tape
- A finite control unit
- A stack with infinite size
