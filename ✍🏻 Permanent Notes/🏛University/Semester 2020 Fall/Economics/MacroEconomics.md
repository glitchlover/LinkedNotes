# Economic Rationale for the law of increasing opportunity cost

Why there is a increasing opportunity costs in ppm? #card 
- because economic resource are not completely adaptable to alternative.
- Some resource is extremely suitable and other is not
- e.g. Some land is highly suited to growing the ingredients necessary for pizza production, but as pizza production expands society has to  start  using  land  that  is  less  bountiful  for  farming.  Other land  is  rich  in  mineral  deposits  and  therefore  well-suited  to producing the materials needed to make industrial robots. As society  steps  up  the  production  of  robots,  it  must  use  land that is less and less adaptable to making their components.

# Present Choices, Future Possibilities
---
An economy's current choice of investing leads to future location of [[MacroEconomics#^8def06|ppc]] #card_spaced

We are creating two kinds of [[MacroEconomics#^8def06|ppc]]
- **goods for the future** :: goods for the future are - capital, education, research etc ^69514a
^1608111847885
- **good for the present** :: good for the present are - consumers good 
^1608111848258
 ^5cf5ec
 
 Suppose there are two hypocritical economics - *Presentville* and  *Futureville*
 
- Are they different? #card
	- They are initially identical but then their approach of investing good is different
^1608111848605

- What are the different? #card 
	- **Presentville** :: Economy that invest lots on  [[MacroEconomics#^5cf5ec|good for the present]]
^1608111848972

	- **Futureville**:: Economy that invest lots on [[MacroEconomics#^69514a| good for the future]]
^1608111849663

- Which one of them are best and why? #card 
	- Futureville
	-  because they increase the *quantity and quality* of **property resources, enlarge the stock of technological information, and improve the quality** of human resources.

## Static and Dynamic Model
**Static Model**:: an economy model where time is constant, inputs are fixed
^1608111850406
**Dynamic Model**::an economy time is not constant, inputs like factors and technology are not fixed, growth indicated by, arrows occur.
